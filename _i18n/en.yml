  first_body: Just Arrived removes all barriers working with newcomers.

testimonials:
  utbudet:
    first: For us it was great to hire through Just Arrived. We contacted Just Arrived on Thursday and already on Monday we had a very competent person who started in our office. Everyone in the office thought it was amazing that we could do something to help a person into the society.
  mentimeter:
    first: To hire through Just Arrived proved to be very simple and fast. The person who performed the task was both polite, curious and open. To get the chance to sit down together, enjoy food from Aleppo and to meet a new Swede made us reflect on the world around us, and gave us the chance at a warm moment together.
    second: The best thing about Just Arrived's service is that you can help people and have a positive impact on the society while at the same time getting a lot back. I want to encourage other companies to do something. Nobody can do everything, but everyone can do something.

  newcomer:
    what:
      question: What do I need to work through Just Arrived?
      answer: <b>If you have residence permit,</b> then all you need is a Swedish bank account.
        <br><b>If you are an asylum seeker</b> then you need AT-UND on item 7 on your LMA-card, a coordination number from the Swedish Tax Agency, and access to a Swedish bank account.
        <br><b>If you are a EU citizen,</b> then you need a coordination number from the Swedish tax agency, and access to a Swedish bank account.
    at_und:
      question: What is AT-UND?
      answer: AT-UND is an exception from the law saying you need to have a work permit to work in Sweden. Anyone who seeks asylum in Sweden, and has identified themselves at the Migration office have AT-UND. If you are unsure, look at your LMA-card. AT-UND is under item 7.
    coordination_number:
      question: What is a Coordinations number?
      answer: You get a coordination number from the Swedish Tax Agency. This is a temporary personal id number consisting of your date of birth plus four numbers. This number is NOT on your LMA-card. To get a coordination number can be difficult. You need a employment contract to get it from the Swedish tax Agency. Just Arrived can’t help at present to get a contract, since we are not the employers and only mediate jobs.
    bank_account:
      question: Do I need to have a bank account of my own to be able to apply for a job?

    get_account:
      question: How can i obtain a bank account?
      answer: Obtaining a bank account as an asylum seeker can be difficult. The requirements differs between banks. The banks with the lowest thresholds requires following<br>
