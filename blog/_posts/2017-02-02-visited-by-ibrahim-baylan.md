Sweden's Minister for Policy Coordination and Energy, Ibrahim Baylan, stopped by [Norrsken House](https://www.norrskenfoundation.org/#norrskenhouse) the other day to talk to us and Welcome Movement!

&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;

To our great joy he concluded:

> I think there is a huge potential that has not been taken advantage of. Especially in the intersection between the digital and the social. Areas where digital services can have a role to play are in matching with the labor market, education and many other areas.
