My name is Tobias and I am 24 years old. After 5 years in Gothenburg at Chalmers University of Technology I finally ended up in beautiful Stockholm, and now after two weeks living here I have started referring to it as home. A few years back while working as a volunteer in South Africa helping children in their education, I realized that I wanted my work life to fill a purpose for other people just as much as for my own, which makes me extra motivated for being a part of the Just Arrived team!

Besides my studies within business design I have been working in the field of software engineering the last couple of years, both at Spotify as a client developer and at Norris Cotton Cancer Center in Los Angeles where I developed a bioinformatics tool to help finding the relationships between DNA methylation and cancer. I love the mix of concrete facts and logic that product development involves in combination with the strategic aspects that the business landscape will demand from you and your product.

The reason why I want to be a part of the Just Arrived team is because I believe that this initiative is a great way to make a positive impact in the Swedish society. Since the service is provided through a technical platform this aligns well with my big interest for software development. The fact that the Just Arrived team consists of high-performing individuals who I can learn from and have fun together with makes me even more motivated to work here!
