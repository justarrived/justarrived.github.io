I am a restless 22-year-old student currently studying business at Lund University. Coming home to Stockholm for the summer from the vibrant student life I knew I had do find some exciting project to keep myself motivated. Luckily I happened to end up in the small and talented team of Just Arrived!

I have had the opportunity to join the Just Arrived team during this very exciting period of product testing and taking the service to the market. Working with promoting the concept of Just Arrived and attract our first amazing pilot companies. It has been great to see the mindset in these companies and I know that that we together can keep inspiring more to follow.

I am a very business-oriented individual that thrives when I can contribute with, and also develop my competence in long-term strategic thinking to progress projects and businesses. Being able to align this with helping people is incredible and this is why I enjoy working with Just Arrived. We have addressed a well-known problem where society seems to be stuck in old ways of operating and found a solution where entrepreneurial thinking and energy is the engine.
