As we're maturing as an organization, the need for telling stories in a visually and emotionally appealing way increases. Therefore, we recently headhunted two amazing talented guys from our platform, who've now joined the core team on the mission to make the vision of Just Arrived a reality.
We're proud to first introduce Abed al Qaisi from Palestine, who is working 50% with us as a videographer.

__Who are you?__

My name is __Abed al Qaisi__. I'm a Palestinian journalist and videographer. I enjoy cooking, music, editing my latest project and being around friends. Prior to coming to Sweden I worked with [HBO](http://www.hbo.com/), [Al Jazeera English](http://www.aljazeera.com/), [USA TODAY](http://www.usatoday.com/), [Discovery Channel UK](http://www.discoveryuk.com/) and the likes on shooting and producing documentary video.

__What do you do at Just Arrived?__

I'm a director and video producer at Just Arrived, where I create videos that teach people about what we do. You'll see them showing up in due time on our website and social media platforms.

__Why do you do what you do? How does your involvement with Just Arrived correlate to who you are, your values and the direction you'd like to develop yourself?__

Being forced to leave your own country and create a new life somewhere else is one of the hardest things our users will ever do. At Just Arrived, I get to be part of a network that makes the whole process easier. The first steps of finding internships, networking and eventually nailing down a job are the foundations of creating a new life in a foreign country, and Just Arrived assists the most vulnerable in our society to do just that. I absolutely love making videos, but making videos for a cause I believe in is more than I ever expected to get a chance to do, so I'm super grateful for my coworkers and the work we get to do everyday.
