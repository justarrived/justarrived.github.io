_Who are you?_

My name is Salam Al Hennawi and I’m 30 years old, I’m Syrian from a city called Swaida and I have a bachelor degree in economics and commerce from Damascus University.
Before I moved to Sweden, less than one year ago, I’ve worked with Ernst & Young as a Risk Management Coordinator-Advisory Services in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

_What do you do at Just Arrived?_

Now I’m working at Just Arrived as a Financial Administrator with our CEO to complete the financial tasks, also supporting the operation team in the communications with Just Arrived subscribers.

_Why do you do what you do? How does your involvement with Just Arrived correlate to who you are, your values and the direction you'd like to develop yourself?_

I was so excited and keen to start my career here in Stockholm and I couldn’t be happier when this opportunity to work with Just Arrived came up, simply because it’s a great initiative. I loved the spirit at the office and the excitement as helping capable, productive and motivated people to find jobs, build their own network, is the greatest contribution that you can offer them and the society.

Just Arrived's platform is one of the best ways to spot the newcomer’s abilities and qualifications, to integrate them in the Swedish labor market, at the same time to give the employers a trustful resource to reach the right person, through Just Arrived dedicated team which I’m proud to be part of it.
