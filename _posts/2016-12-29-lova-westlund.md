My name is Lova Westlund and I’m 25 years old. I grew up in Nacka just outside of Stockholm and now live in Södermalm. I have a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Stockholms universitet. After having finished my studies I worked as a Consultant Manager, where the focus was to find the right person to the right workplace. Following that I changed my career path a bit, and started to work in an organisation that helps people in Sweden without documents to get health care.

In my role as Operations Manager at Just Arrived my main responsibility is to be the contact for newcomers looking for work and to answer all questions through our support channels. But first and foremost it is to build a social and work related network of motivated people who, by doing great work for companies through us, will get references and credentials to help them get further into the Swedish labour market and the Swedish society.

I have always had a strong commitment for helping people, especially people who are in a vulnerable situation. The situation we have today in Sweden regarding handling newcomers and helping them get into the labour market is not working the way it should. Just Arrived offers an easy way for companies to hire newcomers, and by doing so getting motivated people into their organizations. Furthermore, it will give newcomers a more fair chance to integrate into the Swedish society by getting a foot in to the labour market. In other words, Just arrived offers a win-win situation, it couldn’t be better! I'm so glad that I'm part of this driven and dedicated team at Just Arrived, who together are determined to make a real difference and to make Sweden a better and more welcoming place.
