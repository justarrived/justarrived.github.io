There are many ways to find jobs in Sweden. As a newcomer, a natural first step is often to contact the Employment Service (Arbetsförmedlingen), which among other things has been commissioned to help newcomers to the labor market. Good to know is that there is much more work in Sweden than reported to the Employment Service (Arbetsförmedlingen), therefore it's important to look broader. Below are some common ways to find work that may be good to keep track of.

__Job sites__

There are many sites in Sweden where jobs are advertised.


- [Metrojobb](http://www.metrojobb.se/)
- [Monster](https://www.monster.se/)
- [Careerbuilder](http://www.careerbuilder.se/)
- [Stepstone](http://www.stepstone.se/)
- [Blocketjobb](http://jobb.blocket.se/)
- [Platsbanken](https://www.arbetsformedlingen.se/Tjanster/Arbetssokande/Platsbanken/)
- [Indeed](https://se.indeed.com/) works as a search engine that collects jobs from many different sites.
- [Jobbsafari](https://www.jobbsafari.se/) also works as a search engine that collects jobs from many different sites.

__Profession-specific sites__

Many sites that target specific groups also collect jobs from different employers, such as:

- [Ny Teknik](https://www.nyteknik.se/lediga-jobb-teknik/) lists jobs within engineering
- [Computer Sweden](https://csjobb.idg.se/) jobs within IT and system development
- [Resume](https://www.resume.se/Jobb/) is listing jobs within communication and marketing


__Job sites for newcomers__

There are some actors specializing in matching newcomers with employers. They  have multilingual recruitment consultants who can also guide you into Swedish working life.

- [Just Arrived](https://justarrived.se/)
- [Novare Potentials](http://www.novarepotential.se/lediga-jobb)

__Recruitment and agency companies__

There are a lot of staffing and recruitment companies offering jobs at many companies in Sweden. Some of the largest ones you see below;

- [Manpower](https://www.manpower.se/)
- [Adecco](http://www.adecco.se/)
- [Randstad](https://www.randstad.se/)
- [Academic Work](https://www.academicwork.se/jobb)
- [TNG](https://www.tng.se/lediga-jobb)

__Employers own web sites__

Many companies have dedicated parts  of their sites where they post the jobs they want to fill.

__Social networks__

Social networks are becoming increasingly more important in finding jobs today. Some tips on how to use them:

__LinkedIn__

The more you have completed your profile, the more likely you are to appear in the recruiters' searches. Fill out all the jobs, duties and languages you speak. Join groups, preferably about your profession. By commenting and engaging in discussions, your profile becomes more visible to relevant people. LinkedIn will also show you suggested jobs based on your profile.

__Facebook__

On Facebook, there are many groups to convey jobs. Check the groups' flows to find what's relevant to you.

__Twitter__

The tag #nyttjobb is used by most people who post work on Twitter. Keep in mind that you can combine it with other tags for better relevance. For example, #nyttjobb #stockholm #svetsare

Tip! Most sites that publish jobs also offer you the opportunity to get email with jobs that are relevant to you. You can enter yourself and specify which professions and places you are interested in and receive mail when assignments that suit your choices are published.
