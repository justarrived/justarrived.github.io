As we're maturing as an organization, the need for telling stories in a visually and emotionally appealing way increases. Therefore, we recently headhunted two amazing talented guys from our platform, who've now joined the core team on the mission to make the vision of Just Arrived a reality. &zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;&zwnj;

We're proud to introduce Andrew Hawari from Syria, who is working full time with us a graphic designer.

__Who are you?__

My name is Andrew Hawari and I'm 31 years old. I am from Damascus, Syria. I studied graphic design and law in Damascus University. Ten years ago I got my first job as a graphic designer. It had always been my dream to own my own advertising agency. I worked so hard until I finally was able to make my dream come true.

__What do you do at Just Arrived?__

I moved to Sweden in 2015 to start a new life, and to make a new start in my profession. Now, I'm a part of Just Arrived team as the graphic designer, and I work with a great team to keep on improving our product and website.

__Why do you do what you do? How does your involvement with Just Arrived correlate to who you are, your values and the direction you'd like to develop yourself?__

As a graphic designer I send a message with each design that I do, and I really like the message that I got from Just Arrived's logo; giving the helping hand to the newcomers to get into the labour market. Now I'm one of many in the amazing core team at Just Arrived, and I work to give the creativity to each message or helping hand that Just Arrived wants to give, whomever the audience may be.
