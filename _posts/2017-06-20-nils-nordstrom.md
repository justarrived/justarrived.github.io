My name is Nils Nordström and I’m 24 years old. I'm from Gothenburg, Sweden. Besides being a skiing, literature and music fanatic, I am also a recently graduated business student from Lund University. A genuine interest for entrepreneurship and I moved to Stockholm in 2016.

I work as an Account Manager at Just Arrived, which means that I’m responsible for finding, targeting and converting potential leads to satisfied customers. As an early member of the sales department at Just Arrived, my responsibilities also include business development initiatives to help facilitate growth.

Connecting newly arrived immigrants to the labour market is currently one of the biggest challenges that we are facing in Sweden, and through Just Arrived I can help make an impact. I started working with Just Arrived because I wanted to gain valuable experience working with sales and business development, in an early stage start-up, with fantastic growth opportunities. As a bonus I also get to work in a fun environment with great colleagues, where mentorship, entrepreneurship and impact are some of the core values. Win-win-win!
