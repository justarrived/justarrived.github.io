Curious about Norrsken Foundation's [Norrsken House](https://www.norrskenfoundation.org/#norrskenhouse/)? This article from Di Digital reveals some inside information.

> There are two purposes of the house. One is to create a creative cluster where we bring together companies that are trying to make the world better with awesome tech companies we are inspired by. In this way, they might find common solutions.

said Erik Engellau-Nilsson, newly appointed CEO of Norrsken Foundation.

> The second is to create a hype around social entrepreneurship and we hope to create the next generation of rock stars.
