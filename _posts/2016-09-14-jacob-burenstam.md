I'm Jacob Burenstam, grew up in Stockholm, spent almost seven years in Lund and Malmö, before returning to Stockholm in January this year. I studied Computer Science at the Faculty of Engineering in Lund for three years and have since then worked with technology.
I'm one of the co-founders and currently CTO & CPO of Just Arrived. Its has been an amazing journey from the initial idea to where we are now and I'm really excited about our future. It has been an absolute pleasure working with so many awesome contributors, both individuals and companies, that have made this possible.

My main focus now is to make sure the product runs smoothly and together with our amazing team, including Antrop (!), make sure the product gets better and better.
Ever since I learnt how to code I've been looking for ways to contribute to the larger community.
To quote Aaron Swartz: "..being a...programmer is like having super powers, and it would be a shame if Superman just used his powers to make himself rich".

My very first software project, outside of school, was for a charity a friend of mine was starting up. It's actually where my passion started for building things and it's also how I learnt to build things for the web.
We’re constantly looking for passionate and driven contributors, so if you want to contribute don’t hesitate to reach out to us!
