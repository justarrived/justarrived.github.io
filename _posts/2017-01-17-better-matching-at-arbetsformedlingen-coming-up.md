Better matching coming up! The partnership between our friends at [Iteam](https://iteam.se/) and [Arbetsförmedlingen](https://www.arbetsformedlingen.se/) just got official. Up until now, Arbetsförmedlingen has basically just matched on educational background, while now people will be able to be matched to job opportunities by actual competencies they possess.

What feels extra good about this is that it is the result of the non-profit project [Competency](https://competency.se/), initialized at a hackathon with [Refugee Tech](http://refugeetech.com/) spring 2016!
